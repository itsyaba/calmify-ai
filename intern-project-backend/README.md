## Step 1: fetch questions for mood tracking

There are 10 questions written and stored on the backend.These questions will be filled by the user daily.
The questions are always the same and will never be changed.

```sh
URL: http://localhost:5000//mood_tracking/mood_tracking_questions

Request Method: "GET"

when you make request to the backend, make sure to send cookies together with the request!

Successful  Response from the backend contains the following object:
 {
  success: true,
  questions: [
  {
    id: 1,
    question: "How would you rate your overall mood today?",
    type: "scale",
    scale: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    labels: ["Very bad", "Bad", "Neutral", "Good", "Very good"],
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    question: "How much energy did you have throughout the day?",
    type: "scale",
    scale: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    labels: ["None", "Low", "Moderate", "High", "Very high"],

    scale: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    labels: ["Not at all", "Slightly", "Moderately", "Very", "Extremely"],
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    question: "How socially connected did you feel today?",

  },
]
}

```

## Step 2: send user responses to the backend

# Look at the react component example below to see how user responses are recorded and sent to the backend

```sh
URL: http://localhost:8000/mood_tracking/submit_mood_tracking_answers

Request Method: "POST"

Request Body should have array of user responses.
when you make request to the backend, make sure to send cookies together with the request!

Successful  Response from the backend contains the following object:
 {
  success: true,
  message: "Mood responses submitted successfully",
}

```

## The following React component fetches questions, records user responses and sends responses

```sh
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import axios from "axios";

const MoodTrackingForm = () => {
  const [questions, setQuestions] = useState<
    { id: number; question: string; scale: number[]; labels: string[] }[]
  >([]);
  const [responses, setResponses] = useState({});
  const [message, setMessage] = useState("");

  // The "fetchQuestions" function inside useEffect will fetch daily mood tracking questions from the backend.

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchQuestions = async () => {
      try {
        const response = await axios.get(
          "http://localhost:8000/mood_tracking/mood_tracking_questions",
          {
            withCredentials: true,
          }
        );
        setQuestions(response.data.questions);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error fetching questions:", error);
      }
    };

    fetchQuestions();
  }, []);

  // The following function  will handle responses from the user.
  const handleChange = (questionId, value) => {
    setResponses((prevResponses) => ({
      ...prevResponses,
      [questionId]: value,
    }));
  };

  // The "handleSubmit" function will send user rsponses to the backend.

  const handleSubmit = async (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    try {
      const response = await axios.post(
        "http://localhost:8000/mood_tracking/submit_mood_tracking_answers",
        {
          responses: Object.entries(responses).map(([questionId, answer]) => ({
            question:
              questions.find((q) => q.id === parseInt(questionId))?.question ||
              "",
            answer,
          })),
        },
        {
          withCredentials: true,
        }
      );
      console.log("Responses", responses);
      setMessage(response.data.message);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error submitting responses:", error);
      setMessage("Failed to submit responses");
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Mood Tracking</h2>
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        {questions?.map((question) => (
          <div key={question.id}>
            <label>{question.question}</label>
            <select
              title="select"
              value={responses[question.id] || ""}
              onChange={(e) =>
                handleChange(question.id, parseInt(e.target.value))
              }
            >
              <option value="" disabled>
                Select an option
              </option>
              {question.scale.map((option, index) => (
                <option key={option} value={option}>
                  {question.labels[index]}
                </option>
              ))}
            </select>
          </div>
        ))}
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
      </form>
      {message && <p>{message}</p>}
    </div>
  );
};

export default MoodTrackingForm;

```

## Step 3: Fetch average mood score from the backend and display the result on a line chart

```sh
URL: "http://localhost:8000/mood_tracking/mood_tracking_average",

Request Method: "GET"

when you make request to the backend, make sure to send cookies together with the request!

Successful  Response from the backend contains the following object:

 {
  success: true,
    user_ID: user_ID,
   dailyAverages: dailyAverages, # Please note that dailyAverages is not array, it is an object
}

```

## The following react component fetches average mood score from the backend and displays the result on a line chart

First Install necessary dependencies for the Line chart to work perfectly

```sh

npm install chart.js react-chartjs-2

```

```sh

import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import axios from "axios";
import { Line } from "react-chartjs-2";
import {
  Chart as ChartJS,
  CategoryScale,
  LinearScale,
  PointElement,
  LineElement,
  Title,
  Tooltip,
  Legend,
} from "chart.js";

ChartJS.register(
  CategoryScale,
  LinearScale,
  PointElement,
  LineElement,
  Title,
  Tooltip,
  Legend
);

const DailyMoodChart = () => {
  const [dailyAverages, setDailyAverages] = useState({});
  const [labels, setLabels] = useState<string[]>([]);
  const [data, setData] = useState<number[]>([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchDailyAverages = async () => {
      try {
        const response = await axios.get(
          "http://localhost:8000/mood_tracking/mood_tracking_average",
          {
            withCredentials: true,
          }
        );
        const averages = response.data.dailyAverages;
        setDailyAverages(averages);
        setLabels(Object.keys(averages));
        setData(Object.values(averages));
      } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error fetching daily averages:", error);
      }
    };

    fetchDailyAverages();
  }, []);

  const chartData = {
    labels: labels,
    datasets: [
      {
        label: "Daily Mood Average",
        data: data,
        fill: false,
        borderColor: "rgba(75,192,192,1)",
        tension: 0.1,
      },
    ],
  };

  const options = {
    scales: {
      y: {
        min: 1,
        max: 5,
        ticks: {
          stepSize: 1,
        },
      },
    },
    plugins: {
      legend: {
        display: true,
        labels: {
          generateLabels: (chart) => {
            return [
              {
                text: "Good Mood (4.0 - 5.0)",
                fillStyle: "rgba(75,192,192,1)",
              },
              {
                text: "Mixed Mood (2.6 - 3.9)",
                fillStyle: "rgba(192,192,75,1)",
              },
              {
                text: "Bad Mood (1.0 - 2.5)",
                fillStyle: "rgba(192,75,75,1)",
              },
            ];
          },
        },
      },
    },
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Daily Mood Averages</h2>
      <Line data={chartData} options={options} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default DailyMoodChart;
